# About-Project
As we know that the COVID-19 pandemic has now entered its third year. Till the December 2021, the novel coronavirus was raging in almost 200 countries and had killed more than 5.3 million people. We need to come together and fight against it. Lack of awareness among people and not having proper knowledge about the symptoms, not following prevention rules makes the covid cases and deaths higher. So, Core idea of my project as an INTERN at FUTURE READY TALENT is to build a COVID-19 Awareness website which includes all the covid-19 related information with it's symptoms, prevention, treatments, etc. using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, BOOTSTRAP &amp; OTHER JS FRAMEWORKS.
